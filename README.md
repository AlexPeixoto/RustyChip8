# RustyChip8
CHIP-8 emulator written in rust


This is my very first RUST project and it probably beaks a lot of expectations from what a good RUST code would look like.
So it was used as a learning opportunity (this was literally my hello world).

The emulator doesn't have sound (YACH8WA), but at this time it was a design choice basically because there are only beeps
which can easily be done with SFML, but its not being done here, even if the sould timer do exist internally.

The code passes test rom, keyboard rom, PONG, Maze, RNG and probably several others and do not implement Super Chip-48 instructions.

Below are some images of it running
